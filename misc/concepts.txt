Phases of current :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oRT7PoXSS0 

Two coils (on the stator, which holds the coils), up and down, Magnet rotates, disturbance in magnetic field cause 
electrons to move. Due to poles changing, the current reverses. The change is 
gradual since the fields are oval in shape and hence looks like a wave. 
1 Cycle = 1 rotation = once up and once down, freq = cycles/rotations per sec. 

1 phase : large gaps and probably not efficient. 

2 Phase : 2 more coils, 120 degrees from first 2 coils from either side (side should be same for both). 
3 Phase : add 2 more coils on the other side to the one chosen for 2 phase.


Induction Motor:

2 parts :
Stator : slots having 3 coil windings which carry 3 phase AC
Rotor : Loop of conduction material on which EMF from the coils will induce a current.
As per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force, the coils will start to rotate.
freq of current controls the speed.



Dataset :
each file has 10000 3-phase current readings. 
There are 317 files, which means the readings were taken for 317 seconds. 
There are 3 columns in each file represent the 3 currents.
Based on the information provided, it seems unlikely that the frequency of the 
current supplied is 10K Hz, as this is much higher than the typical frequency of AC power in most regions,
which is usually around 50-60 Hz. It's possible that the data is being sampled at a rate 
of 10K-15K Hz, but this would not necessarily reflect the frequency of the current itself.

 Since each file represents one second of data and each file has 10,000 readings, 
 the sampling frequency of the data is 10,000 Hz (samples per second). 
 Therefore, the frequency resolution of the FFT would be 10,000/2 = 5000 Hz, 
 which means you can accurately detect frequencies up to 5000 Hz in the data.

he sampling frequency refers to how many times we measure the current in a given time period. In this case, we measure the current 10,000 times every second.

The frequency resolution of the FFT tells us how many different frequencies we can accurately detect in the current data. The maximum frequency we can detect accurately is half of the sampling frequency. So if the sampling frequency is 10,000 Hz, we can accurately detect frequencies up to 5,000 Hz.
This means that we can use FFT to analyze the current data and detect any frequencies up to 5,000 Hz that may indicate a problem with the motor. For example, if we detect a frequency at 1,000 Hz, we know that there is something happening with the motor at that frequency. However, if there is a frequency at 6,000 Hz, we would not be able to detect it accurately with this sampling frequency.

The code is extracting the magnitudes of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th harmonic frequencies of the current data. These harmonic frequencies are multiples of the fundamental frequency of the AC power supply. In this case, the fundamental frequency is set to 50 Hz.
Extracting these three harmonic frequencies allows for the analysis of the distortion in the AC power signal caused by non-linear loads, such as electric motors. In particular, the 3rd harmonic can be an indicator of motor problems, as it is generated by the interaction between the stator and rotor magnetic fields in the motor. By comparing the magnitudes of these three harmonic frequencies to expected values for normal operation, it is possible to detect potential problems with the motor.

This code loads the data from the specified folder, renames the columns, scales the data, trains an Isolation Forest model on the scaled data, and then uses the model to predict anomalies in new data. However, you will need to perform motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis to create condition indicators and features to train the ML model.

As for the three columns, they most likely represent the current readings of each phase of the 3-phase AC motor. However, without more information about the data, it's impossible to know for sure.

Motor current signature analysis (MCSA): This is a technique used to analyze the electrical signals produced by an electric motor, such as the 3-phase induction motor in your case. MCSA involves taking current readings from each phase of the motor and analyzing the frequency spectrum of these readings. By analyzing the spectrum, you can identify any anomalies or patterns that may indicate a potential fault or failure in the motor. MCSA can be used to detect various types of faults, such as broken rotor bars, bearing defects, and winding faults.

Model-based VI analysis: VI stands for vibration and current analysis, and this is another technique used to detect anomalies in electric motors. Model-based VI analysis involves creating a mathematical model of the motor and using it to predict the expected behavior of the motor's electrical and mechanical signals. Any deviations from the expected behavior can then be flagged as potential anomalies. This technique is particularly useful for detecting faults in the mechanical components of the motor, such as bearings and gears.

Once you have performed MCSA and model-based VI analysis on your data, you can create condition indicators and features that can be used to train an ML model. Condition indicators are parameters that reflect the health of the motor, such as vibration levels or temperature readings, while features are specific characteristics of the data that can be used to train a model to predict anomalies. Some examples of features that could be extracted from your data include frequency spectrum peaks, statistical properties of the data, and time-domain features. By combining MCSA, model-based VI analysis, and feature engineering, you can create a robust ML model that can accurately predict anomalies in your 3-phase induction motor.

How to do motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis to be done to detect anomalies in python on the given dataset

Performing motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis in Python can be done using various libraries and tools. Here are some steps you could follow to perform these analyses on your given dataset:

Load the data: You can use the pandas library to read in the text files in your data folder and combine them into a single dataframe.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

df = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f, header=None) for f in datafolder])
Perform motor current signature analysis: You can use the scipy library to perform Fourier transforms on the current readings from each phase of the motor and plot the resulting frequency spectra. This will help you identify any anomalies or patterns in the spectra that may indicate a fault in the motor.
python
Copy code
from scipy.fft import fft

fft_data = fft(df)
Perform model-based VI analysis: To perform model-based VI analysis, you will need to create a mathematical model of the motor that takes into account both its electrical and mechanical behavior. This can be done using tools like MATLAB/Simulink or Python libraries like pyEMD. Once you have created the model, you can use it to predict the expected behavior of the motor's electrical and mechanical signals and compare it to the actual behavior to detect any anomalies.
scss
Copy code
import pyEMD

emd = pyEMD.EMD()

imfs = emd(df)
Create condition indicators and features: Based on the results of your MCSA and model-based VI analyses, you can create condition indicators and features that can be used to train an ML model. For example, you might extract frequency spectrum peaks, statistical properties of the data, or time-domain features.
python
Copy code
import numpy as np

peak_freqs = np.argmax(fft_data, axis=1)
mean_currents = np.mean(df, axis=1)
By following these steps, you can perform motor current signature analysis and model-based VI analysis on your dataset in Python and extract relevant features for training an ML model to detect anomalies in the motor. However, keep in mind that these analyses can be complex and require domain expertise to perform effectively.


How to detect anomalies from peak_freqs = np.argmax(fft_data, axis=1)
mean_currents = np.mean(df, axis=1)?

Please write in English language.
Once you have extracted the frequency spectrum peaks and mean currents from your data using the code peak_freqs = np.argmax(fft_data, axis=1) and mean_currents = np.mean(df, axis=1), respectively, you can use these features to detect anomalies in the motor.

There are various ways to detect anomalies, but one common method is to use a statistical approach based on the distribution of the feature values. For example, you could calculate the mean and standard deviation of the feature values and define a threshold for detecting anomalies based on how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is. Any feature values that fall outside this threshold would be flagged as potential anomalies.

Here's an example of how you could detect anomalies in the peak frequency data using this approach:

makefile
Copy code
import numpy as np

# Calculate mean and standard deviation of peak frequency data
mean_freq = np.mean(peak_freqs)
std_freq = np.std(peak_freqs)

# Define threshold for detecting anomalies
thresh_freq = mean_freq + 3 * std_freq

# Identify potential anomalies
anomalies_freq = np.where(peak_freqs > thresh_freq)[0]
This code calculates the mean and standard deviation of the peak frequency data and defines a threshold for detecting anomalies as three standard deviations away from the mean. Any peak frequency values that fall outside this threshold are identified as potential anomalies and stored in the anomalies_freq array.

You can use a similar approach to detect anomalies in the mean current data or any other features you extract from your data. However, keep in mind that the choice of threshold and statistical method may vary depending on your specific application and dataset, and you may need to adjust these parameters based on your domain knowledge and the performance of your ML model.



FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to convert a signal from time domain to frequency domain. In this context, by using FFT on the current sensor data, we can identify the frequencies at which the current is changing. This is because when a machine is running properly, the current will have a predictable pattern of frequency changes. If an anomaly occurs, it can often be detected by changes in the frequency spectrum of the current. Therefore, by using FFT, we can identify potential anomalies by examining the frequency spectrum of the current data.

MCSA is a technique used to detect faults in induction motors by analyzing the current signals that the motors produce. In a healthy motor, the current signals should be smooth and sinusoidal. However, when there is a fault in the motor, the current signals can become distorted, and the shape of the signal can change.

One common fault that MCSA can detect is broken rotor bars. Broken rotor bars can cause the current signals in the motor to become uneven, and the difference in current readings between different phases of the motor can increase. 
The equation BrokenRotorBars = abs(current_1) - abs(current_2) calculates this difference in current readings between phases 1 and 2, which can be used as a condition indicator for broken rotor bars.

Bearing faults can also be detected using MCSA. When there is a fault in a motor bearing, the current signals can become noisy, and the difference in current readings between different phases of the motor can change. 
The equation BearingFault = abs(current_2) - abs(current_3) calculates this difference in current readings between phases 2 and 3, which can be used as a condition indicator for bearing faults.

Finally, eccentricity is a fault that can occur when the motor's rotor is not perfectly centered in the stator. 
This can cause the current signals to become uneven, and the difference in current readings 
between different phases of the motor can change. The equation Eccentricity = abs(current_3) - abs(current_1) calculates this difference in current readings between phases 3 and 1, which can be used as a condition indicator for eccentricity faults.
